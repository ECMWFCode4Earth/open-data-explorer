This one-stop shop Open Data Explorer provides you with tools to explore ECMWF real-time forecast data ([IFS](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/open-data) and [AIFS](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/dataset/aifs-machine-learning-data)). These open data are available to the public free of charge.

Are you a researcher, operational meteorologist or meteorology enthusiast?
It will guide you through the following steps:
- accessing open data,
- downloading data from the FTP server,
- and analysing data using Python libraries.

The Open Data Explorer also includes a wide variety of case studies. Check out the content pages bundled with this handbook to see more.
